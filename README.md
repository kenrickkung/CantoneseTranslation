# CantoneseTranslation
Third Year Project for Bsc Computer Science in University of Manchester

## Introduction
This projects focuses on developing models for translating Cantonese sentence to English sentence, where the models trained has obtained comparable results against State-of-the-Art commercial models (Bing, Baidu).

User Interface is provided to test out the models.


## User Interface
To run the user interface for demonstration purposes, you should first download the model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S53nHDP8Sc9n378-WilFB-yFOeGguFCl).  

The models should follow the same folder structure as in Google Drive under the Backend folder in the GitHub Repo.

Run the following code in terminal to start the Backend

```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirement.txt
python app.py
```

To run the frontend user interface, run the following code in terminal.

```bash
cd Frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
The user interface should be correctly setup on http://localhost:3000/.
